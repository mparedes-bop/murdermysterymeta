# Murder Mystery Meta
## You are invited to a fancy dinner party where you play a murder mystery game with your old friend. During the game, someone is found dead under mysterious circumstances. The game is no longer just a game. It is real life. Can you interrogate the dinner guests, clear your name, and find out who the murderer is before they strike again? Or will you be next? 
## Murder Mystery Meta is a completely text-based game coded in ChoiceScript. ChoiceScript is an easy to use coding language specifically designed for coding text-based games. Many of its commands are intutitive and simple for even the most clownest of clowns. 
### For example, one of the commands in Choicescript is ```*create``` This command is an argument followed by something that quantifies the argument. For example, let's say we want to create a variable that checks if you read a character's diary. We can use true or false, numbers, or a string to quantify it. That command might be something like this: 
### ```*create diary_read false```
