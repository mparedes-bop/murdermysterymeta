The living room is dark and eerie. Someone flicks a switch; dark, pristine Victorian furniture glows under the soft lighting of a chandelier hanging low. The entire room is immaculate, but the place smells like a garage sale. You don't feel like a person in this room; you feel like an observer looking into a glass bowl of a model of Nora's living room. You would think no one had ever stepped into the room if there was a speck of dust anywhere. Do the Rosenwoods even live in their own home? 

"Somebody died here," Monte says casually as she stretches her arms behind her head. 
*if rebuff_monte = 0
  Monte gives you an impish smile. 
 
"Alright everybody!" Nora clears her throat. "In a few minutes we will officially begin the murder mystery game. Now is the time to take out the invitations sent in the mail a few weeks prior. Does anyone not have an invitation?" Nora pauses for a millisecond. "Great! The invitations have all the information you need to know about your character, including their gender,
name, and background. The invitations do NOT say if you were murdered or are the murderer. Nobody knows anything about the murder until the clues come out in each round. Now let's briefly talk about the rounds..." 

For some reason, you feel compelled to pay attention,  as if Nora is giving instructions for a game even bigger than this murder mystery game you are all playing. 

"The first round is the appetizer round. I will give you all clue cards while you mingle with the other guests. It is imperative to divulge any information on your invitations during the respective round and to the respective recipient of the character. This rule must be followed during all rounds." 

"In round two, the victim will be notified they are the victim. The victim must wear a sign stating they are the victim. If you are the victim, don't worry! You can still play and help along the investigation. Consider yourself as the ghost of the character you were playing. Once the victim is revealed, the investigation round will begin. Continue to mingle and interact with the other guests and more evidence is uncovered."

In the corner of your eye, you spot a tall shadowy figure listening in. When you turn back to it, the figure is gone. You give a brief glance to Lexa, who is oddly engrossed in Nora's long-winded dialogue for the game. Lexa seems to be interested in the justice side of things; maybe she can help you find the figure later, when the game starts. 
*comment maybe move that blip about Lexa to a more relevant talk

"Round three is where the fun begins. We start with a small accusation round, and after everyone has made their accusations, I will hand out these 'solution cards' to everyone. Everyone will read out their involvement in the solution and the murder, if any. The murderer will confess at the end. Once that has been sorted, we'll have a brief awards ceremony for anyone who has acheived anything extraordinary in the game," Nora pauses to take a breath. "Each round will be about forty-five minutes long, with a break inbetween. Before we start, take a few minutes to clarify your characters and their information." 

All the guests pull out freshly-printed papers from seemingly nowhere. You self-consciously smooth your crumpled invitation from your pocket. 

[i]Greetings! You have been invited to a roaring speakeasy at 138 Greenwich Avenue...![i/]

The Pinkerton Detective Agency is special in the way it was one of the few companies that hired both men and women. Regardless, it's not like a modern-day murder mystery game cares too much about gender roles, but Nora insisted you distinguish the gender of your character for the purpose of the murder plot.

[i]You caught wind of the speakeasy through illicit backchannels in Manhattan. A speakeasy is the perfect place to advertise your moonshine stills and equipment, at never before seen prices. Your equipment is made to last and dirt cheap. Maybe the speakeasy guests don't need to know it's because the core components of your product are lead and arsenic. You're pretty sure lead and arsenic are good in moderation, anyway.[/i]

Your character sounds like a complete jerk. Is this what Nora really thinks of you?
*if rebuff_monte > 0
	Maybe she's not far off considering the way you treated Monte. 

[i]You're a smooth talker, quick on your feet, and could charm the hide off of a snake. Once you introduce yourself to everyone, they'll be sure to brighten up to you fast. Although some might note that you look a little suspicious, you shrug off criticism like water off a duck's back. People don't like travelling salesmen until they get to know them, after all.[/i]

At least you have some positive traits. Your eyes stop at a line of fine print. 

[i]SUGGESTED OUTFIT: 3-PIECE SUIT AND TIE WITH ALLIGATOR SKIN LOAFERS[/i]

Costumes? Nora never mentioned costumes. 

"${mc_name}!," someone calls. "Nora wants you in the closet."

*label escoffier_secret
[i]You were officially hired by Gal Capone to cater some delicacies from your home country of France. Along with some lovely hors d'oeuvres, you have prepared your signature dish for the dinner; coq au vin. A peasant dish suited for a group of American peasants. You never would have said yes to the gig if Gal Capone wasn't offering you a ridiculous amount of money, all in cash, in exchange for your food and your presence. You're not too proud to serve wets.[/i]

Hopefully you weren't actually expected to cater. 
*if intelligence < 10 
	You don't even know what "coq au vin" is. 
[i]You're sophisicated, snobbish, and condescending. Nothing less is expected of a French cook. You have a certain magnetic charm and grace around you, and the other guests (especially the men) respond to it. Your elegance is reflected everywhere about you; you walk with the poise of a ballerina, you smile like someone just told you a very big secret. You are the pinnacle of propriety. Act like it![/i]

This character seems like a lot to live up to. You only hope you can give her justice. On the bottom of the invitation, you eye a line of fine print: 
[i]SUGGESTED OUTFIT: SHORT SUMMER DRESS WITH COLORFUL CLOCHE HAT AND SCARF[/i]

Like a costume? When did Nora talk about a costume?  

"${mc_name}!," someone calls. "Nora wants you in the closet."  
*goto costumes 

*label milton_secret 
[i]Former Pinkerton Agent turned private detective, you have been investigating Gal Capone for a few years now. You considered her impossible to track, way too many red herrings, too much of smoke and mirrors. That is, until you discovered a poster advertising the speakeasy in a well-hidden bar on the seedy side of town. You used a little elbow grease to get your ticket in, but now you're right next to the Queen herself. Can you get Gal Capone behind bars before she figures something's up?[/i]

Seems like your character has a pretty big secret. You wonder if this means you'll play a big role during the game. 
*if charisma >18 
	If it is, you'll be pretty psyched. You're already outgoing in real life, so this will be a piece of cake and fun to boot. 
How did Nora pick out these characters for everyone? You're not sure if this is really you. Could you even pull off being a devious detective? You scan the invitation further. 

[i]You're a detective with years of experience. Being perceptive, creative, organized, and logical comes naturally to you. You can reason most things out, and you don't act before thinking. You're cool and collected nearly to a fault. If you had any faults, that is. Confidence is another important part of being a detective, and you have a fair bit of it. Sometimes you're so logical you're nearly rigid, but that's not a huge flaw. Maybe you have a tendency to overthink and overanalyze too, if you're really being anal about yourself. Overall, you know there's no one better suited to taking Gal Capone down.[/i]

There's a sentence even lower in small font. You squint to read it: 
[i]SUGGESTED OUTFIT: TRENCH COAT WITH SHERLOCK HAT AND MAGNIFYING GLASS[/i]

Suggested outfit? Nora never said anything about that. 

"${mc_name}!," someone calls. "Nora wants you in the closet."

The broom closet is the size of your living room. Inside are a bunch of flashy coats and accessories. There are even labels everywhere - one side says suits, another says dresses. There's a whole box labelled "cravats" and on top of the closet are shoe racks with their sizes marked from size 3 kids to size 13 mens. The amount of effort and planning Nora went into with this party is seriously impressive. Although you can't help but think that having two CEOs for parents helps a good amount. Felix and Milos are inside, trying on clothes. Felix is wearing a stuffy blue pinstripe suit and scowling at the mirror. Meanwhile, Milos is drowning in his suit pants struggling to find his size. 

Nora suddenly materializes in front of you. She has an expression on her face halfway between smiling and halfway between crying. "Thank goodness you're here, ${mc_name}. And not a moment too soon." 

"You told me to come here," you note. 

"I did, yes. The important thing is that you listened to my request and summarily arrived. That is the marking of a true friend."

"What do you need?" 

"Well, for starters, I need you to find your costume quick. Did you read the invitation? I wrote a suggested outfit down there for you. You don't need to listen, of course, but I think it would match your character nicely. Get dressed as soon as you find something to wear, and come back to me. We really need to get this game going," Nora runs a hand through her hair. She's very frazzled.

		"I don't know about this, ${mc_name}."
		"Just give it a try," you insist. "It'll make you feel better."
		"All right. Only a few breaths," Nora softly breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth. She slows done for a beat, then takes a deeper breaths. After a minute or two, the color has restored to Nora's features.

		"And now," you continue. "You have to pull yourself together and muster up one last burst of energy to really get this party started. I know you can do it, Nora. You just have to believe in yourself."

You take a minute to admire yourself in the mirror. You must admit, you look quite "jazzing" in your timely ${outfit}. Nora will definitely appreciate your choice of costume. That is, if you can find her. You saw Nora scurry away before you started getting dressed, no doubt she's out micro-managing a crisis. Felix and Milos are still trying on outfits. They're facing away from each other, and they look like magnets when you repel them.

"Felix," you approach. He turns back to you, eyes wide. 

"${mc_name}! Sorry if you're busy, but could you give me a hand with this?" Felix gestures to the tie. "I have no clue how to tie this thing." 

"Sure thing," you say. "let me see it."

The tie is knotted in half a dozen places. You are almost impressed that Felix managed to tie a tie this poorly. 

"Is it bad?"

*fake_choice
	#"It's not good."
	#"It could be worse."
	#[Lie] "Not at all." 
"I hate wearing suits. I can't believe Nora managed to convince me to put one on for the party," Felix grouses.

You let out a sympathetic [i]mmmm[/i] as you carefully undo each knot in the tie. "Nora can be a lot sometimes," you admit.

"She's fine. I have to be true to my character and my character wears a suit." 

"I fixed it. Want me to tie it around your neck?" You ask. Felix nods. You smooth both sides of the tie on either end of Felix's neck. Recalling

you attempt to replicate the results on Felix. He's the perfect person for this, you consider. He hasn't moved an inch the entire time you've been tying the tie on him. Felix is at complete peace with himself. You're almost a little jealous. He's managed to stay calm the entire time you've known him, which hasn't been very long, you admit. Nora mentioned something about California, but why anyone would move from California to here of all places eludes you. Your train of thought immediately disappears when you feel your hands brush against Felix's neck. Felix doesn't move or evince any sign that he noticed the touch, but his face gets a little flushed.
